-- Write a SELECT query that returns a list of names of everyone who has bid in 
-- the auction. While it is possible (and perhaps easier) to do this with a JOIN 
-- clause, we're going to do things differently: use a subquery with the EXISTS 
-- clause instead. Here is the expected output:

--       name
-- -----------------
--  Alison Walker
--  James Quinn
--  Taylor Williams
--  Alexis Jones
--  Gwen Miller
--  Alan Parker
-- (6 rows)

SELECT name FROM bidders WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT 1 FROM bids WHERE bids.bidder_id = bidders.id);

-- More often than not, we can get an equivalent result by using a JOIN clause, 
-- instead of a subquery. Can you figure out a SELECT query that uses a JOIN clause 
-- that returns the same output as our solution above?

SELECT name FROM bidders
INNER JOIN bids
ON bidders.id = bidder_id
GROUP BY bidders.id
ORDER BY bidders.id;
