-- We've realized that the last two parts we're using for device number 2, 
-- "Gyroscope", actually belong to an "Accelerometer". Write an SQL 
-- statement that will associate the last two parts from our parts table 
-- with an "Accelerometer" instead of a "Gyroscope".

UPDATE parts
SET device_id = 1
WHERE part_number = 7 OR part_number = 8;
